# Maze Solver Bot - Technoxian 2023 Winner

## Overview
This project is a **maze solver bot** that utilizes the **flood fill algorithm** to navigate and solve a maze autonomously. The bot was developed for the **Technoxian 2023 Maze Solver Competition**, where our team 'HAWKS' emerged as the **winner**.

## Features
- Uses **Arduino Nano** as the main controller.
- Employs an **array of 5 IR sensors** for line detection.
- Utilizes **TB6612FNG motor driver** to control movement.
- Implements the **flood fill algorithm** for pathfinding.
- Stores and updates maze values in **EEPROM**.
- Equipped with **two 600 RPM micro metal gear motors** for precise movement.
- Supports **OLED display for debugging and monitoring**.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Nano** (Microcontroller)
- **TB6612FNG** (Motor driver)
- **5 IR sensors** (Line detection and obstacle detection)
- **2 x 600 RPM micro metal gear motors**
- **OLED Display** (Optional for debugging)

## Software & Algorithm
### **Flood Fill Algorithm**
The bot utilizes the **flood fill algorithm** to navigate through the maze efficiently. The key steps include:
1. **Scanning walls** at the current cell using IR sensors.
2. **Updating the flood fill array** based on available paths.
3. **Choosing the optimal path** with the lowest flood value.
4. **Navigating to the target cell** while avoiding obstacles.
5. **Updating the maze map** and saving progress in EEPROM.

### **Code Structure**
The codebase is divided into multiple files for modularity:
- **`micromouse.ino`** - Main program logic (setup and loop functions).
- **`motors.ino`** - Motor control logic.
- **`debug.ino`** - Debugging utilities and serial monitoring.
- **`floodfill.cpp / floodfill.h`** - Flood fill algorithm implementation.
- **`globals.h`** - Global variables and constants.
- **`menu.cpp / menu.h`** - User interface and display functions.
- **`save_maze.cpp / save_maze.h`** - EEPROM functions for saving and loading maze data.

## How to Use
### **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PRASANTH9819/MAZE-SOLVER
   ```
2. **Upload the code to Arduino Nano** using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Assemble the hardware** as per the component list.
4. **Power on the bot** and place it at the starting position.
5. **Calibrate the sensors** and start the bot.
6. The bot will **scan, navigate, and solve the maze** automatically.

## Future Improvements
- **Implement machine learning** to optimize pathfinding.
- **Enhance sensor accuracy** using better calibration techniques.
- **Develop a wireless debugging system** to monitor bot performance in real-time.
